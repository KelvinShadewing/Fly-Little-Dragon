## **About the Game**

In *Fly, Little Dragon!*, you play as a tiny, flying character trying to outrun a much larger predator. By collecting cereal, you keep up your stamina, and by tricking your predator into eating the birds that fly by, you can slow them down, but be careful, because birds can knock you into the waiting Maw of Over'd Games. Eating enough cereal without getting hit by a bird will give you a sugar rush, making you temporarily invincible against both birds and preds.

There are three game modes: singleplayer, multiplayer, and dual single. In single player, you control with the arrow keys or left gamepad stick. In multiplayer, second player uses WASD or a second game pad. In dual single, one player controls both characters, either with a combination of WASD and arrows, or both sticks on a single gamepad.

Bonus points are earned by feeding birds to the pred. In multiplayer, the player who is closer to the pred will get the points, as they are the more daring player, but will also be the pred's target. The game ends when all prey characters are eaten. As the game progresses, birds will become more common, and some will even target one of the players.

## **Join the Feast!**

Commissions will be opened to allow players to buy sprites and have them added to the game. While the game is open-source and can have any sprite added at any time, buying a sprite will ensure it matches the style of the game and will allow your character to be seen by everyone who plays. If you do not want to be in the game but would still like to support development, you can donate on my **[LIberapay](http://www.liberapay.com/kelvinshadewing)** or my **[Ko-Fi](http://www.ko-fi.com/kelvinshadewing)**.
